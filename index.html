<h2> My Introduction</h2>
<p>        
  <br>I am originally from Chicago Illinois. 
  <br>When I retired in 1997, I moved to Phoenix Arizona. I have two grown children named 
  <br>David and Sally, Sally lives with me in Phoenix. Since I am retired, I have lots  of 
  <br>free time, but I try to keep active. I go to Esporta fitness three to four times a week, <br> ride my bike, hike the various trails in and around Phoenix, and take classes. 
  <br>I have no long-range goals; I just like to learn new stuff and acquire new skills.
